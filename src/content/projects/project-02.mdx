## Project Overview

I served as the **Gameplay Engineer** for an educational VR experience designed for the Department Museum. The goal was to make learning about computer history interactive and immersive.

## My Contributions

I engineered the core gameplay loop using **C# and Unity**:
*   **Interaction Mechanics:** Physics-based object handling for museum artifacts.
*   **Tutorial Progression:** A state-machine based tutorial system to guide new users.
*   **Audio System:** Implemented spatial audio to enhance immersion.

## Collaboration

This project required close collaboration with an interdisciplinary team. We utilized **Git and GitHub** for version control, managing merge conflicts and feature branching in a team environment.
