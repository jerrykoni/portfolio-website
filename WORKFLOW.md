# Project Workflow

## 1. Development Environment

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (Latest LTS recommended)
- VS Code with recommended extensions (Astro, Tailwind CSS, Prettier, ESLint)

### Setup
Run the following command to install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

## 2. Daily Workflow

### Start Development Server
To start the local development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```
The site will be available at `http://localhost:4321`.

### Code Formatting & Linting
- **Formatting**: Code is automatically formatted on save using Prettier.
- **Linting**: ESLint is configured to catch errors. Run `npm run lint` to check manually.

### Building for Production
To build the static site:
```bash
npm run build
```
To preview the build:
```bash
npm run preview
```

## 3. Deployment
(Update this section with your specific deployment target, e.g., Vercel, Netlify, GitHub Pages)

## 4. Working with Antigravity
